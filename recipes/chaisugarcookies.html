    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla and mix until well combined. Mix in flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the chai spice mix, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until combined.</li>
        <li>Stir together 1/4 cup white sugar and 2 teaspoons of the chai spice mix in a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into 1 tablespoon-sized balls. Dough will be slightly sticky, but should still roll into a ball. Roll each ball in chai spice-sugar mixture until coated. Place dough balls 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until they begin to crack on top and look slightly set, 10 to 13 minutes. Cool cookies on pan for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
